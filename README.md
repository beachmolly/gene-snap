# GeneSnap 🌱🧬

**GeneSnap** is an interactive, educational React application designed to help users explore genetic information 🧬 through fun visualizations 🎨 and games 🎮. Users can learn about their genetic makeup 🧬🧑‍🔬, inheritance patterns 🔄, and how certain traits are passed down through generations 🔬. With a focus on visualizing DNA sequences 🧬 and chromosome structures 🧬🔍, **GeneSnap** aims to make genetics engaging and approachable for students 📚, hobbyists 🎨, and anyone curious about the science of heredity 🌱.

## Features ✨

- **Interactive DNA Visualizations**: Visualize DNA sequences and chromosomes to understand genetic information.
- **Educational Games**: Fun, interactive games that teach inheritance patterns and genetic traits.
- **Explore Your Genetic Makeup**: Learn about traits passed down through generations in an interactive way.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Easy-to-navigate UI with smooth interactions, powered by Tailwind CSS for modern and responsive styling.
